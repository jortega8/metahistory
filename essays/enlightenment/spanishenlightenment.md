## What about Spain? 
When we think about the Enlightenment what comes to mind? It’s usually names like Voltaire, John Locke, and Immanuel Kant. And when we think of geologically about where the Enlightenment took place we usually go in our minds to England, France and Germany, and even Scotland and the Scottish Enlightenment. While there is a lot of meat to chew on with these major Enlightenment Figures and where they were from in Europe, we have to wonder for a second where is Spain’s place in the Enlightenment? Or was there Enlightenment Ideas taking place in Spain at all? Was Spain some sort of dark space where the rest of Europe was lighting up with Enlightenment ideas while Spain was toiling in darkness. In fact Spain did have a place in the Enlightenment but just in a different way that was nuanced and under the radar but it did in fact happen as we go through this meta-history we will see some of the major historical writers who influenced Spain during the enlightenment like Guizot, and Vico and also look at the leader ship of Spain at the time particularly looking at King Charles the 5th and his policies and how they affected Spain and its relationships with the rest of Europe and Spain’s colonies in the Americas. After that we will move on to Spanish Colonialism and how some of Spain’s Enlightenment policies affected Spanish Colonies in the New World and look at some different examples from Cuba to the Philippines and the legacy of colonialism and the effects of the Spanish Enlightenment on the people and land of the former Spanish Empire.
